# üéÆ IoT Motion Controller  
### Jesper Morais & David Stenman

## Overview

This project explores the use of motion-controlled input using ESP32-based hardware in a scalable, wireless, and low-latency environment. Each device operates as a standalone motion controller using its onboard IMU (e.g., MPU6050), capable of tracking tilt, orientation, and acceleration.

Sensor data is transmitted via UDP to a **headless Go server**, which is responsible for interpreting input and broadcasting it to connected WebSocket clients. This modular design ensures that the server can be easily integrated into different applications and frontends ‚Äì from games to industrial interfaces.

In the current implementation, a Godot-based UI visualizes the motion of each controller as a unique, colored on-screen entity (‚Äúblob‚Äù), enabling multiple users to interact in real time.

## üß© Architecture

### ESP32 Controller (Client)
- Collects motion data (accelerometer and gyroscope)
- Sends periodic updates via UDP
- Identified uniquely via MAC address

### Go Server (Headless, Modular)
- Listens for connection requests and sensor data
- Assigns a unique color index to each client
- Forwards processed motion data to WebSocket clients
- Designed to be frontend-agnostic

### Godot Client (Example Frontend)
- Receives WebSocket updates
- Renders and animates real-time motion of each player
- Associates blobs with MAC address and assigned color

## üí° Use Cases

- Multiplayer mini-games controlled through motion input  
- Interactive installations where physical gestures control on-screen elements  
- Educational tools for demonstrating motion sensing and real-time networking  
- Custom IoT dashboards for device orientation feedback  
- Prototyping gesture-based interfaces for smart environments

## üéÆ Interaction Design (Current Demo Capabilities)

The current demo implementation visualizes each controller as a moving blob in 2D space. While simple in presentation, it lays the foundation for more advanced interaction mechanics:

- **Tilt Control**: Smooth movement across screen based on device inclination  
- **Rotation Input**: Gyroscope data available for rotation-based gestures  
- **Impulse Recognition**: High acceleration along Z-axis can be interpreted as actions like jump, dash, or selection  
- **Modular Input Pipeline**: Easily extended to gesture recognition, custom thresholds, or contextual triggers

This modular system highlights the potential of motion input in lightweight multiplayer experiences and embedded systems ‚Äî all without the need for tethered hardware or high-cost sensors.
